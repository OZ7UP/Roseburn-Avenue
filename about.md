Officially formed as part of [the Fandori Project](https://fandoriproject.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"} in January 2019 (and named seven months later), Roseburn Avenue is a doujin band inspired by the voice actresses of Roselia, one of the six (as of 2021) live bands from the "BanG Dream" multimedia franchise. While the band is firmly within the hard rock genre, the influences that go into the songwriting and arrangement processes are varied, including but not limited to ambient sounds, idol music, folk rock, and electronicore.

In other words, if someone from the songwriting team likes something, they'll find a way to integrate it into their music.

As of early 2021, Roseburn Avenue has become its own entity beyond being just a band, with its YouTube Channel becoming host to "Project ASAKAZE", a side project focusing on rearrangements of popular anime and J-game songs (especially from other Bushiroad franchises), as well as rock and pop songs.

### The band's name:

![A couple of street signs in a Singaporean neighbourhood, with one saying "Dunbar Walk" and the other saying "Roseburn Avenue".](/assets/images/98EAB3E3-58A6-463F-A3F8-2E78C9853F66.jpeg)

Roseburn Avenue was named after a street in a Singaporean neighbourhood where Zach grew up. The actual street simultaneously runs parallel and perpendicular to Dunbar Walk, on which he lived. Zach was inspired to name the band as such while visiting the country on vacation in August 2019.
