Officially formed in January 2019 (and named seven months later), Roseburn Avenue is a doujin band inspired by the voice actresses of Roselia, one of the six (as of 2021) live bands from the "BanG Dream" multimedia franchise. While the band is firmly within the hard rock genre, the influences that go into the songwriting process are varied, including but not limited to ambient sounds, idol music, folk rock, and electronicore.

In other words, if someone from the songwriting team likes something, they'll find a way to integrate it into their music.

As of early 2021, Roseburn Avenue has become its own entity beyond being just a band, with its YouTube Channel becoming host to "Project ASAKAZE", a side project focusing on rearrangements of popular anime and J-game songs, especially those from other Bushiroad franchises.
