Well, it took just slightly over a year, but in the end, the most important thing is that we finally managed to release “Tsubame”. Working on the song definitely was not easy on my part due to my poor mental health throughout the first half of 2021, but I was able to dig deep and see things through.

There were quite a few firsts for me throughout the songwriting and recording process. It was my first time ever writing a vocal line for a song (I found a really useful hint from Fraser Edwards’ Patreon page), it was my first time playing a bass from the Warwick family (a Rockbass Corvette $$), it was my first time using a cloud-based DAW via an iPad to record my parts, and it was the first time that my recorded vocals actually sounded close to my natural singing voice, thanks to a microphone that I backed on IndieGogo on a whim.

Of course, the biggest takeaway from all this was that we, as a team, got there. Some of us have had to deal with our personal demons, but because we all knew where we were headed, we knew exactly when and how to support each other.

I’m proud to call everyone in Roseburn Avenue my friends.

We have a couple of songs in the skunkworks. Given that the songwriting process on the music side is mostly complete (John wrote one of them during a lull last year, and I wrote the other one back in 2017), it’s just a matter of finding the time and energy to iron out everything.

Take care, and stay safe.
