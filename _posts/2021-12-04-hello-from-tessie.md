Greetings everyone! My name is Tessie, though you can call me Tess. I am the lyricist for Roseburn Avenue, hoping to perhaps eventually join as a musician and singer as well. 

I found out about the Fandori Project on Twitter alongside a friend and, as a big fan of Bandori, I decided to join and see if I can make a contribution. I was the lyricist for Poppin'Party's and Argonavis' songs, but later on ended up more involved with Roseburn Avenue after I was done with lyrics for the aforementioned songs. While I haven't yet managed to progress on goals I'd have liked to have done by now, I will keep going on. Again, learning an instrument and how to sing are my immediate goals when it comes to Roseburn Avenue, as well as improving on my lyrics. 

To fans here now and future, I hope you'll have a good time with our songs! Thank you very much for listening to them!

Tessie
