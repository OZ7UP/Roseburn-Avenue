Roseburn Avenue is pleased to announce that our most recent project is now officially complete.

Due to the context in which we decided to work on the project, we are unable to officially share the video for another week or so. However, we can reveal that it is an English-language hard rock cover of a song from the "Love Live" multimedia franchise.

We can't wait to release the song.
