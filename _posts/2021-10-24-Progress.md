This year's been a bit of a roller-coaster ride, with Zach losing his uncle towards the end of March and with his mental health in a questionable state for the first half of the year. Despite the challenges, however, he was able to push through and write most of the base song and the vocal melodies.

The fact that he was able to renew both his Residence Card and his Australian Passport certainly helped a lot, plus all those staycations he took using the money he saved from not travelling for most of 2020. Given that he's now fully vaccinated (and that's all we will say about this matter), he is looking forward to setting foot out of Nagasaki City towards the end of the year for pleasure, unlike his trip to Osaka to renew his passport.

As of today, the instrumental track of the song is mostly complete, with just the lead keyboard parts to be added. The current tentative deadline for the vocal parts has been set for November 7th. If all goes well, the song should be released before Christmas.

We at Roseburn Avenue absolutely can't wait for you to hear our new song.
