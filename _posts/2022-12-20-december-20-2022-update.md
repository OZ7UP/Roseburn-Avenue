We would like to apologise for the lack of updates. Unfortunately, real-life obligations have not exactly been kind.

The good news, however, is that the band is still active, and currently have three projects (two covers, and one original) in the works. There will be stumbles moving forward, but rest assured these projects will be completed.

In other news, our guitarist John has been fairly busy on the Project ASAKAZE front. Our Covers page has been updated accordingly.

Our bassist Zach can now be reached on Mastodon. Please view our "About" page for the link.

With any luck, our next update will not take as long to be posted. All the same, we wish you all well. Stay healthy and hearty, no matter where you are in the world.
