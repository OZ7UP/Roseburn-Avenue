We hope that this update finds you well.

Rita has chosen to depart Roseburn Avenue for personal reasons.

Rita has been an essential part of the band from its early days, and was instrumental in bringing life to our three original songs, "Minato", "Beneath the Waves", and "Tsubame". During the recording process for each of the three songs, we would always look forward to listening to what she would bring to the table; suffice to say, she would knock it out of the ballpark every single time.

We are sincerely grateful for her contributions, and we wish her nothing but the best in her future endeavours. Roseburn Avenue has been fortunate enough to be graced with the opportunity to work with a talented vocalist as Rita; it has been an absolute honour.

In the meantime, Zach will be taking over Rita's vocal parts for our immediate project (a cover song). Any news about finding a replacement vocalist will come towards the end of February.
