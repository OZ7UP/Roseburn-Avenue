Zach here. I was originally going to post something two days ago on my birthday, but unfortunately, working from home (due to a prefecture-wide online two-day conference) prevented me from doing so.

Besides, it was also "Shoulder Day", and I try to avoid skipping that.

I'm typing this up right now on the Sasebo Liner from Nagasaki Station en route to Huis Ten Bosch for a much-needed proper vacation, so I'll be quick. Simply put, I'm writing this to state just how grateful I am to be a part of Roseburn Avenue from the beginning.

Things haven't exactly gone perfectly during the band's early days. My leadership style could be charitably called controversial, displaying the worst of both Yukina and Chu-Chu from the mainstream Bandori series. It's fair to say that I'm obviously not proud of my behaviour back then.

Even with that said, I wouldn't trade those horrible days for anything else. If anything, I needed to know my character flaws so that I could work on improving myself.

More importantly, though, it was because of the entire experience, including both the good and the bad, that allowed me to not only live out my dream of being in a band (albeit in an unconventional manner), but to also become friends with a group of wonderful people, namely Roseburn Avenue itself.

It's because of Roseburn Avenue that I've started taking bigger steps towards trying out new things, and I will forever be grateful I am for everything that has happened. Here's to hoping that once things have started to settle down even more, we'll be able to hang out together in real life, preferably here in Japan.

P.S. I was going to talk a bit about my current recording setup for both bass and vocals, but that can wait a couple of days.
