Roseburn Avenue is proud to release its English cover of the Love Live song, "No Exit Orion". This song was recorded as an entry for the 2022-2023 "Love Live: World Wide!" cover event presented by 9Mermaids.

While the original version as performed by Printemps was already intense enough, this English cover elevates the intensity to another level by combining passion and power from the band's vocalists, and tying everything together through updated drumming and intricate lead instrumental melodies from both John and thewhitewhale.

Of course, the band is never one to rest on its laureals, and you can expect an updated version to be recorded and released in the future.
