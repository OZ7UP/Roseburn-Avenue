Roseburn Avenue is an internet-based international rock band with members based around the world. As a part of the "Fandori!" doujin project, Roseburn Avenue is originally inspired by Roselia, one of the active live bands from the "BanG Dream" multimedia franchise.


Roseburn Avenue is a passion hobby for its members. While there will be a bit of a long wait in between original song projects due to "In Real Life" obligations, you can be assured that when the band releases something, you will enjoy it.
