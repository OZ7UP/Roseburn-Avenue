Hey everyone, apologies for the lack of updates. RL obligations have been a bit crazy recently.

The recording process has officially started for our current project. If things go well, the song should be released towards the end of September. With that said, we won't be resting on our laurels just quite yet as there's another song in the pipeworks.

On a personal note, I've been having a bit of fun experimenting with my recording setup. I'm not saying if it'll make it into the final version of our current project, but there's something satisfying about using a modern budget smartphone as your main recording computer.

Take care!
