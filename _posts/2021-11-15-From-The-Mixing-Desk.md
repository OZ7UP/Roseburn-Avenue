With the guitar solos re-recorded, the instrumental mix is, for the most part, done and ready for the next part: vocals and mixing.

Following up on the idea of trying new things – my previous interface’s finally given up the ghost after the longest time, and I hope its replacement will stick with me longer – notwithstanding that it’s better value for money. Zach’s gotten a new mic and set it up too, which I’m adamant will bring our recordings to a whole new level.

That being said, the weather hasn’t been kind to my throat either – even though I’ll be the last to add my vocals since I’m mixing and ensuring we all sound like we’re singing together, I’d hate to be caught unprepared when the time comes.  

With the latency blues out of the way, I’ve even managed to incorporate what might be the band’s first proper duelling solos between myself and thewhitewhale, all in the midst of an already busy mix. 

It suffices to say that we are excited (I’m buzzing, I dare say) for the upcoming release, and more so in light of the instrumental mix as it stands. I’m looking forward to bringing the vocals together once we’re done recording on that front.
