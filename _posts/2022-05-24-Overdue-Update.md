title: May 2022 Update

It has been a while since our most recent update, in which we announced our music would officially be released on music streaming platforms. As such, we'd like to briefly let you know some of our upcoming plans.

John has started arranging our first official cover song. We won't spoil you with the group (or the song), but judging by the drums track that John has arranged, we believe you'll like our interpretation of the song.

Zach will be checking into a hotel on the final weekend of the month where he'll be recording a bass line or two. He also intends to start songwriting again to add to the band's skunkworks list.

As an additional note, we intend to re-record and re-master our current original songs, including "Minato", for a future re-release; this is to show our growth as musicians. This will be reliant on Zach's personal situation; it is his aim to do this in late 2023 using his personal bass rig back home in Melbourne, Australia.

We sincerely hope that you'll look forward to what we have planned.
