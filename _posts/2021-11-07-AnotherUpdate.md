Our forthcoming song is one of many firsts – among them, the first Roseburn Avenue song with Tessie’s involvement, the first to be written partly in Japanese (also, the first John has written in any non-native language), the first involving Zach on vocal melodies, and the first to incorporate clear symphonic elements.

Looking back on the songwriting process among Zach, John and Tessie, it has been a journey in every sense of the word - one in which ideas were left on the cutting-room floor, occasionally picked back up, and inspirations took an unexpected turn - even through such things as the then-nascent Project ASAKAZE, accidentally leaving the wah pedal on, and wrestling with our most complex arrangement yet. We even managed to discuss a little about our songwriting process in our talk show.

But our preference, of course, is to have the music speak for itself.

We can't wait.
