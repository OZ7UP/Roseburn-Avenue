Well.

We're back on the first version of our website.

We'll spare you the technical details, but long story short, there was a dependency error for the code we were using for Version 2 of our website, which made pushing changes to it impossible. As such, the decision was made to revert back to using this site.

If anything, it'll make it much easier for both our songwriters to write posts for the site directly via Github.

On the music side of things, if you've been following us on Version 2 of the website, "Journey's Reflection" has been successfully released. Feel free to check it down below, or under our Music section.

The band is also hard at work on their upcoming release. We hope you'll look forward to hearing it.
